# dxpb-clj

FIXME: description

## Quickstarts

### Play with importing the package graph

- Clone the repo
- Set and probably export the following environmental variables:
- `ARCH_SPEC_WHATGOESHEREDOESNOTMATTER='{:XBPS_ARCH "x86_64-musl"
  :XBPS_TARGET_ARCH "x86_64-musl" :cross false}'`
- `OWNED_PACKAGES_PATH=~/void-packages` (or wherever your void-packages is)
- run `lein repl`
- Wait for the dependencies to be installed
- Run the following code blocks one per line in the repl
- `(start-arch-specs)`
- Just to prove it works at all:
- `(time (import-packages :package-list '("gcc")))`
- And then to do the big one:
- `(time (import-packages))`

### Assumptions Built In

If you want to use this on a package manager other than xbps, with xbps-src,
please consider the following assumptions that are baked deep into the
codebase. They hold true for xbps, they may not hold true for your application.

1. Every package has exactly one current version (a previous version may be in
   the repos).
2. That version is the same across all builds
3. Every package has a unique package name.
4. Packages have dependencies that must exist before they can build.
5. Once a package is built for a target architecture, it's available on that
   target architecture.
6. You have a way to ensure a package is available to your builders once it's
   available to the DXPB server.
